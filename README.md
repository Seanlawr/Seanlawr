- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Seanlawr
I'm an ex-teacher looking to transition careers. I've started my data analytics and data science journey very recently and want a repository for practice projects to 
demonstrate how my learning is coming along. Feel free to look at what I've got and add qyestions and comments.

Seanlawr/Seanlawr is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
